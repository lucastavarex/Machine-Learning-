# Introduction to Machine Learning - EEL891

```
This repository stores the final projects related to the Introduction to Machine Learning course, taught by Professor Heraldo during the 2023.2 period at UFRJ. The projects consist of two machine learning models - one for classification and one for regression - that were submitted to competitions on Kaggle.

Classification Model
This is a classifier used to assist in making credit approval decisions. Its objective is to identify, among customers who request a credit product and who meet the essential prerequisites for approval, those who present a high risk of default, that is, who have a high probability of not being able to make the payment correctly.

Regression Model
It uses regression techniques to estimate the value of a property based on its characteristics.
